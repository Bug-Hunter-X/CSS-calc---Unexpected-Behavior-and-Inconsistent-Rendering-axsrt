The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results when used with percentages and other units.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not behave as expected if the parent element's width is not explicitly set.  The calculation might be performed before the parent's width is determined, leading to incorrect results. Another subtle issue arises when using `calc()` with multiple units that may change dynamically.  Incorrect order of operations or unexpected unit handling can cause layout issues.  Finally, browser inconsistencies in interpreting complex `calc()` expressions can lead to rendering differences across platforms.
