To mitigate these issues, ensure that parent containers have explicitly defined dimensions (using `width`, `height`, or other relevant properties).  Additionally, refactor complex `calc()` expressions into simpler ones, possibly using intermediate variables or helper classes to break down the calculation into smaller, more manageable steps. If percentages are used along with fixed units or other dynamic units, carefully consider the calculation order and test across various browser environments to identify any rendering inconsistencies.  You might have to use JavaScript or CSS variables to improve calculation control and predictability.
